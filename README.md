# Hokku Generator (Genetic Algorithm)

This project explores generating short Japaneese style three-line poems hokku using a Genetic Algorithm.
A hokku consists of three lines following a 5–7–5 syllable pattern.
Poems are generated by selecting words from a fixed vocabulary and arranging them into three lines.
